# README

This app was designed as part of a student project for The Hacking Project. The aim of the project was to design several landing pages for the same thing (THP), but for different targets and then promote them through bots, and work on aquisition with a mailchimp mailer.

* **TEAM** : Marie-Charlotte Le Morvan (html, css, design), Charles Belpois (mailer, analytics), FranÃ§ois De Saporta (bots)


* **Design** : We chose not to use any bootstrap template, but rather to make our own responsive template. 1. Because MC like design and making her own things and 2. because we are unemployed and poor...
The design is inspired from flat design and material design. We used nice UI gradients with homemade codes as a background.
Used icons from flaticon.com


* **Structure** : We used a typical landing page structure, with just the right amount of information. It's a scrolling page with 4 parts :
- Part 1 is the landing page itself, with the catchphrase and CTA button only > the most important things.
- Part 2 is a "how to" page, explaining some details on how THP works
- Part 3 is a testimonials page
- Part 4 is a callback to the CTA (subscribe to the newsletter).


* **Landing pages** : We designed 3 landing pages:

ðŸ‘© One aimed at women, with a girly theme and women testimonials : https://the-hacking-project-lyon.herokuapp.com/femme

ðŸ‘¨ One aimed at high school students, with an emoji packed theme, an adapted copy and student testimonial : https://the-hacking-project-lyon.herokuapp.com/lycee

ðŸŒ† One aimed at people from Lyon, with an adapted copy (available all throughout France...) and testimonials : https://the-hacking-project-lyon.herokuapp.com/lyon


* **Aquisition** : We designed bots to promote the site.


* **Metrics** :
